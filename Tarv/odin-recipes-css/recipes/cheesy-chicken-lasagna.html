                <li>3 each skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped </li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic </li>
                <li>2 (26.5 ounce) cans spaghetti sauce, divided </li>
                <li>2 (15 ounce) containers part-skim ricotta cheese </li>
                <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste </li>
                <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese </li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add chicken breasts; reduce heat and let simmer until chicken falls apart easily with a fork and is no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain water, shred chicken with 2 forks, and set aside.</li>
                <li>While chicken is boiling, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and lay noodles in a single, flat layer on a paper towel to dry.</li>
                <li>Heat butter in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot butter just until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Mix shredded chicken, onion-garlic mixture, 1 cup spaghetti sauce, ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning together in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Mix remaining spaghetti sauce and remaining Parmesan cheese together in another bowl. Spread a thin layer on the bottom of a glass 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles, spread chicken mixture on top, then add another thin layer of the sauce mixture. Repeat, leaving a final layer of noodles on top. Top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella and Cheddar cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese bubbles, about 45 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
